are Booklets?</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Booklets allow you to stitch together multiple saved reports 
into a multi-page presentation style layout. Booklets are intended to behave 
like document-style presentations but with the added ability to interact with 
the charts and filter the data as you page through the individual reports. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Booklets are <u>not</u> affected by any changes that you make 
to a saved report, even if that report has been “added” to a Booklet. This is 
because when you create a Booklet from saved reports in your catalog, you are 
actually creating copies of the selected reports that are now specific to that 
Booklet. </p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
