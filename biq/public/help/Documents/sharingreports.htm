Reports</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The report sharing feature allows you to “push” analyses that 
you created to other BIQ users without having to leave the application. From the 
Saved Reports screen, click on a report in your catalog, and then click the 
SHARE button. When you do, you will be prompted to specify another user 
(recipient) in the Share Menu:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As you begin typing in names, you will be prompted with 
potential BIQ users in your organization. If you check the box to “Notify 
existing recipients via email?” , a text box will appear in which you can type a 
message to the users. When you click OK, the report will immediately show up in 
the recipients’ Saved Report catalog, and they will receive an email from 
MarketMover telling them that you have shared a report with them (if you added 
an email notification).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To “un-share” a report, click the SHARE button as before and 
when the Share Menu appears, click on the EXISTING RECIPIENTS tab. You will then 
see a list of users with whom you have shared the report. To unshare, click the 
UNSHARE button after placing a check next to the desired user(s) (or click OK). 
If you check the box to “Notify existing recipients via email?” the existing 
recipients will receive an automated email informing them that you revoked their 
access to a report.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A recipient of a report you share can delete the report from 
their catalog, but they can never edit a report that you created. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Similar to the Reports and Booklets page, BIQ gives you the 
ability to share reports directly from the Builder Page. After saving your 
report, click on the SHARE button and follow the steps outlined 
above.   </p>
