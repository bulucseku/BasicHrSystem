<h3><a name="_Filtered_Metrics" id="_Filtered_Metrics"></a>Filtered Metrics</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you apply a filter to a BIQ report definition, that 
filter will be applied to every metric included in the report. Sometimes, 
however, you may want to apply different filters to different metrics or even 
different filters to the same metric. The ability to target your filters to 
individual metrics comes in handy when your data repository has many different 
metrics with their own dimensions (i.e. attributes specific to each of 
them).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For example, say you once again wanted to view your company’s 
shipments to US Foods Company (a distributor), and also in the same report see 
any rebate claims that your company received for your breads and rolls products. 
Applying normal filters in this case will generate a result that is likely 
different from what you are looking for:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image15_14.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The results may look right, but think carefully. Both filters 
have been applied to both metrics. But what we <b>wanted</b> to see was the 
total shipments to US Foods, not just the shipments of bread and rolls products 
to US Foods. Similarly, we were interested in <b>all</b> rebate claims on bread 
and rolls purchases, not just the ones involving US Foods. Filtered metrics are 
what allow you to do this.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Create a filtered metric as follows:</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -36pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 57.6pt; tab-stops: 57.6pt 68.4pt" class="MsoNormal">1.       Click on a metric header 
in the report definition to expand the menu as you do to specify the sort order. 
</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -36pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 57.6pt; tab-stops: 57.6pt 68.4pt" class="MsoNormal">2.       Click on the funnel icon 
in the menu (this will only appear for metrics). </p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -36pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 57.6pt; tab-stops: 57.6pt 68.4pt" class="MsoNormal">3.       A notice on the top right 
corner will briefly appear to inform you that you can now click on a filter 
value to create a filtered metric. </p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -36pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 57.6pt; tab-stops: 57.6pt 68.4pt" class="MsoNormal">4.       Scroll through the filter 
panel to find the exact value that you would like to filter the metric by, and 
single-click on that value.</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -36pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 57.6pt; tab-stops: 57.6pt 68.4pt" class="MsoNormal">5.       The metric name in the 
report definition will now show the filter value in parentheses alongside 
it.</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -36pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 57.6pt; tab-stops: 57.6pt 68.4pt" class="MsoNormal">6.       After creating a filtered 
metric, the funnel icon will turn into a pencil. Clicking the pencil icon allows 
you to modify the filter value you have selected.</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -36pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 57.6pt; tab-stops: 57.6pt 68.4pt" class="MsoNormal">7.       <b>Note: </b>Creating a 
filtered metric will un-check that metric in the column panel so that you can 
add it again. This enables you to create multiple different filtered versions of 
the same base metric in a report.<b></b></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 21.6pt" class="MsoNormal">The report proposed at the 
beginning of this explanation should look like this using filtered metrics:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 21.6pt" class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image15_15.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Filtered metrics allow you to target applicable filters to 
different metrics, or create multiple filtered versions of the same metric. This 
is especially powerful for doing side-by-side time period comparisons (YoY, MoM, 
etc.), product-to-product comparisons, and similar analytical comparisons.</p>
