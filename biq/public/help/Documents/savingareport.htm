Report</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you have executed a report that you want to keep 
longer-term, you can click the SAVE button beneath the Report Definition panel. 
When you click SAVE, BIQ will prompt you with a suggested name for the report, 
which you can keep or modify as you wish. Once you click OK, the report will now 
be in your Saved Report Catalog in the Reports and Booklets page in BIQ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is important to realize what is actually being saved. When 
you click SAVE, you are not saving the report results. Rather, what is being 
saved is the report definition itself, along with the last visualization that 
you specified. When you open a saved report later, you are in fact calling up a 
report definition, which will execute as soon as you open it. <b>This means as 
long as your report definition does not have any specific time bounds (e.g. a 
filter value set to a specific month in the past), you will get an up-to-date 
report based on the latest data available.</b></p>
