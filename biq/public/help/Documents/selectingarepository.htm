a Repository</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Your organization will have one or more data repositories 
available for analysis. When there is only one repository, MarketMover will 
automatically detect and select that repository, and no user action is 
necessary. If more than one is available, you will be prompted at login to 
specify which repository you want to open as shown here:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Each repository has its own data structure â€“ in other words, 
its own set of columns that you can use to create a report. The repository 
selection thus determines which columns and filters are available on the screen 
to select from:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To switch repositories while working in BIQ, you can click on 
the dropdown list and simply choose the repository that you want to open. Note 
that saved reports and booklets are specific to each repository. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To view information about the repository that you have 
selected, simply click on the repository information icon that is located next 
to the repository dropdown list. </p>
