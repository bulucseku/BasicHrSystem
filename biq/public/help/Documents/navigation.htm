<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-TOP: 12pt">BusinessIQ contains two main pages 
which you can navigate to using the buttons near the top of the page. Report 
Builder contains the tools for designing new reports, whereas the Reports and 
Booklets page is where you create new booklets, and retrieve/view either reports 
or booklets you have saved or that have been shared with you. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">The Report 
Definition</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the top-middle of the Report Builder canvas, you will see 
the Report Definition panel. As you select columns and filters to create a 
report, the Report Definition will dynamically update to reflect what you have 
selected in the Column and Filter panels.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <img src="../ImagesExt/image10_5.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Report Definition panel contains the instructions that 
tell BusinessIQ what data to bring back and how to present it. After you have 
selected columns and any filter values, the VIEW and RESET buttons will 
activate. Clicking VIEW will execute your report exactly as specified in the 
report definition. Clicking RESET will clear the definition so that you can 
start over. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The SAVE button is only activated after you have executed the 
report by clicking VIEW. If you make any changes to the report definition after 
executing the report, the SAVE button will deactivate again, though your 
original result set will remain visible, searchable, sortable etc. on the 
screen. The SAVE button deactivation is to prevent confusion for the user when 
the results visible on the screen no longer match the instructions in the Report 
Definition panel.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
