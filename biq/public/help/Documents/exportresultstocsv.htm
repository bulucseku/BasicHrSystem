<h3>Export Results to CSV</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Just above the search bar in the Report Grid panel on the 
right, you will see an icon that looks like a page with a down arrow on top of 
it. Clicking this button will export the full result set to a CSV file, and 
should immediately bring up the file as well. You can then save or email the 
file as necessary. This is one way that BusinessIQ makes report results 
portable. The other way is through the saving and sharing features that are part 
of the application itself, which are discussed in a later <a class="topic-link" href="sharingreports.htm">section</a>. </p>
