<p class="MsoNormal">Depending on your exact configuration, the answer is a 
qualified “yes”. An intuitive user interface isn’t worth much if the data is 
disjointed or otherwise hard to interpret. Before MarketMover is deployed, 
Sentrana works with your company to determine which data it wants to include in 
the system, and then works to cleanse that data. You should have a separate 
document prepared by Sentrana that explains how your company’s data is 
integrated in BIQ and the Dashboards, what the column names mean, and how the 
different fields can be combined. </p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
