Saved Reports</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you click the EDIT button under a saved report, you will 
be automatically taken back to the Report Builder screen. The report definition 
for the selected report will be displayed, along with a notice informing you of 
what takes place when you click SAVE versus SAVE AS. You can hide the message by 
checking the “Don’t show again” box and clicking DISMISS:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can now start making any desired modifications to the 
report definition. The SAVE and SAVE AS buttons will activate only after you 
execute the report by clicking VIEW. If you click SAVE, then the changes you 
have made will be committed. <b>Important:</b> If you have shared the report 
that you are editing with any other users, the changes you have saved will be 
immediately promulgated to those users as well. Clicking SAVE AS will prompt you 
to enter a new report name so that you can leave the original report un-changed, 
if you prefer. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you click CLOSE before you save any changes, the report 
definition will clear, and you will no longer be editing the original saved 
report. You can now create new reports as usual. Clicking CLOSE after you save 
changes to the report ends the editing session for the original report and 
clears the report definition.</p>
