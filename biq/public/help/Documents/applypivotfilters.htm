<h3>Apply Pivot Filters</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Using pivot filters can be a simple and quick way to view the 
data that is important to you. In the example below, “Master Group” was added to 
the filter section in the configure window. Once applied, a dropdown list of all 
groups will be displayed allowing you to select an individual category which 
will update the results accordingly. Filters are very flexible allowing for 
select, multi-select, date, date range and others depending on the filter you 
apply.</p>
