<h3>Adjusting the Number of Rows to Display (Using the Row Slider)</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you bring back an entire large result set in your chart, 
you may not be able to read the data labels very well, and your chart may also 
be difficult to interpret. The select rows feature lets you fine-tune how much 
data should be visible in the chart in a simple way. The slider has two 
drag-able “handles” that you can move back and forth using your mouse. 
Alternatively, you can also click on a handle with the cursor, and then while 
the handle is highlighted use the left/right arrow keys on your keyboard to move 
the handle and change the row display. In addition, you can also manually input 
the row ranges using your keyboard. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As stated in the introduction to this section, the sort order 
of the grid influences what is visible in the chart. For example, when you 
adjust the row slider to show rows 1-20, what you are really telling BIQ to do 
is, “show rows 1 to 20 as they currently appear in the report results grid”. 
Re-sorting the table will automatically adjust the chart display. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Note that by default, BIQ will collapse all rows not 
displayed into an ‘Other’ total (if showing rows 1 through <i>n</i>, this will 
appear as the (<i>n + </i>1)<sup>st</sup> row. To get rid of the ‘Other’ row, 
you can de-select this feature in chart settings, explained in the next 
section.</p>
