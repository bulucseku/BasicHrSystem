a Report after Execution</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you modify the report definition at all after executing a 
report, the SAVE button will deactivate. This is true even if you restore the 
report definition exactly as it was before. To re-activate it, simply re-execute 
the report by clicking VIEW. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> The purpose of this feature is to prevent confusion as 
to what exactly is being saved in the case where a user has executed a report 
then modified the definition. In other words, which is being saved – the 
results, or the definition? This is why you can only save a report after it has 
been executed and not subsequently modified.</p>
