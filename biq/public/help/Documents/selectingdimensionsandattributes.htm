Dimensions and Attributes</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Attributes are the second type of column, and they complement 
metrics in your report definition. Think of attributes as the dimensions by 
which you want to “slice and dice” your metrics of interest. For example, if you 
want to break out your sales performance by region, the “region” is the 
attribute and sales is the metric. Beneath the Standard Metrics and Derived 
Metrics in the column panel, you will see a longer list of attributes (under 
Attributes) that allow you to segment the data. Attributes will be grouped by 
Dimension. A dimension is effectively a core concept such as “Geography”, 
“Product”, “Time”, “Sales Hierarchy” and so on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You cannot perform arithmetic operations on attributes, even 
if the value is numeric. For example, you can break out sales by ZIP code by 
selecting ZIP code as an attribute. However, BIQ will not let you sum or average 
ZIP codes in a report (this is taken care of behind the scenes when the software 
is configured).</p>
