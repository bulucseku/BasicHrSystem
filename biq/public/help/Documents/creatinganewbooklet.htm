<p class="MsoNormal">To create a new Booklet, click on the Add Booklet Button, 
which is visible only in the Reports and Booklets panel. When you do, the 
Booklet Composition panel will appear in the report canvas:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The first step in creating a new Booklet is adding reports 
from the “My Saved Reports” sub-panel to the “Booklet Structure” sub-panel. This 
is accomplished by either selecting a report from ‘My Saved Reports’(which will 
highlight when selected), and then clicking on the arrow icon, or by double 
clicking on a report to automatically add it to your new booklet structure. You 
can also add multiple reports at once by holding the CTRL button on your 
keyboard and selecting the reports you want. Once these reports are highlighted, 
simply click on the arrow icon and the reports will be added to your booklet. To 
remove a report that you have added, simply click on the ‘X’ icon that is 
visible next to each report name in the Booklets Composition sub-panel. You can 
also add the same report multiple times to a booklet. When creating a new 
Booklet, you will only be able to use saved reports which you have created and 
saved or for which you have edit privileges to. When you add a saved report from 
your catalog to the Booklet Structure, you are creating a local copy of that 
report. It is easiest to think of this as a copy-and-paste operation: you are 
telling BIQ to create a copy of the saved report, and then paste that copy into 
the Booklet Structure. Adding a saved report to a booklet has no effect on the 
original report. Any changes that you make later on to the original saved report 
will not affect the copy that was pasted into the Booklet Structure. </p>
