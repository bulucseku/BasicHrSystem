a Saved Booklet</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">To view a Booklet in presentation mode as opposed to 
edit-mode, click VIEW when you want to open the booklet instead of edit. The 
Booklet Composition panel will not be visible, and instead you will have just 
the report to view on the screen (you can also minimize the Saved Reports panel 
to maximize your viewing space). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Navigation through the booklet works the exact same way as in 
preview mode. Note that, for individual reports that are part of the booklet you 
are viewing, you can still show/hide the grid or chart, filter columns and 
metric ranges, and interact with the charts and tables as usual. Changes made, 
including range based and column based filters, will not be saved to individual 
reports in your booklet.  </p>
