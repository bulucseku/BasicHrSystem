<h3><a name="_Column_Filters" id="_Column_Filters"></a>Column Filters: Results Transformation 
 </h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">After a report has been executed, you are able to take 
advantage of column filters using the Results Transformation dialog. Column 
filters allow you to sip through the report grid, limiting the rows you want to 
see in a column based on a specific selection. For example, if you only want to 
see the shipped cases for a specific Product Group in your product hierarchy, 
all you have to do is click on the Results Transformation icon, expand the 
column header, select that particular product group and click OK. You can select 
more than one filter option. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">BIQ will then automatically update the report chart and 
report grid based on your selection. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is important to keep in mind that any column filter 
selections made in either the Builder page or the Reports and Booklets page 
<b>do not persist</b>; they are simply visual changes that cannot be saved to 
the report you are viewing and are discarded when you perform any other action 
or navigate away from the page.  </p>
