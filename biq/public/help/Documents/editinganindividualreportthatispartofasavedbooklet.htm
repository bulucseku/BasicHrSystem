<h3>Editing an Individual Report that is Part of a Saved Booklet</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you open a Saved Booklet in edit mode using the EDIT 
button, you will see the Booklet composition panel. Clicking PREVIEW when in 
edit mode gives you the additional feature to modify the definition of an 
individual report that is in your booklet. This is more convenient than creating 
a separate saved report, adding that to your booklet structure, and then 
deleting the report that you no longer need in the booklet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When previewing a saved booklet in edit-mode, you will see a 
pencil icon next to the arrow and Results Transformation icons. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The pencil icon is for editing that individual report (more 
specifically, the copy that is specific to this booklet). When you click the 
pencil icon, you will immediately be taken back to the Report Builder screen, 
with the report definition for that report populated.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can now make any edits you wish using the standard Report 
Builder functionality. Click VIEW to execute the report definition, and then the 
SAVE and SAVE AS buttons will activate. Note the following points:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">14. Clicking 
SAVE in this scenario will update only the local copy of this report which is 
part of the Booklet you are editing. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">15. Clicking 
SAVE AS will not update the local copy that is part of the Booklet. Rather, it 
will create an entirely new saved report in your catalog that you can treat like 
any other report (including adding it to other booklets).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you want to modify the changes in the copy that is part of 
the Booklet you are editing, and also create a new stand-alone saved report, we 
recommend performing the SAVE operation first, then performing the SAVE AS to 
create the new report.</p>
