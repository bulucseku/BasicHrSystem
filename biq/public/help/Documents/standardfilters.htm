<h3>Standard Filters</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Filters are arranged in the user interface in the panel on 
the right-hand side and are grouped by dimension. You will notice that most if 
not all of the dimensions available in the column panel also appear in the 
filter panel. When you click on a dimension in the filter panel, the section 
will expand to reveal the selection options. Depending on how many elements you 
can choose from, you may see different screen controls, such as check-box lists, 
collapsible trees, and other views. You may sometimes, depending on the 
selection mechanism, need to hold the CTRL key while you click on the available 
options to select more than one filter.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A standard filter (which we will usually refer to simply as a 
‘filter’) will be applied to every metric in the report definition. </p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
