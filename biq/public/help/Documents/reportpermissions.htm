Permissions</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The available actions you can perform on a report depend on 
whether or not you were the original author of that report. For reports that you 
created, you can perform all possible actions (See Details, View, Edit, Copy, 
Delete, Share). On the other hand, you cannot edit a report that has been shared 
with you by another user. Depending on your configuration, you may or may not be 
able to re-share a report that has been shared with you. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you would like to either edit or share a report that has 
been shared with you, the easiest thing to do is to create a copy of the report 
and give it a unique name. You will then have full permissions to edit and share 
the report copy.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
