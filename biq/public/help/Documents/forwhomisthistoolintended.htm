<p class="MsoNormal">BusinessIQ is intended for anyone who needs to perform 
analyses or use data to do their job. BIQ is a more free-form tool that allows 
users to explore data, generally without restrictions. For those who want to 
drill into the data, generate insights, share findings with others, test 
hypotheses, and generally understand the data, BIQ is the tool for you. Many 
other different types of users typically need to consume reports to make 
tactical decisions or identify areas in need of attention. Dashboards, because 
the visualizations are predefined and the drill-paths set ahead of time, are 
ideal for users who do not want to explore or create reports from scratch.</p>
