and Modifying a Report Definition</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Creating a report in BusinessIQ is easy; you don’t have to 
write any database code or understand core database concepts. If you know what 
your data means and how it can be sliced and diced, you’re more than halfway 
there. It’s easiest to first think through what you are looking for in terms of 
what the final results table should look like:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">1.  What 
are the pieces of information that I want to see?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">2.  How do 
I want to narrow down my results?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Columns are the individual pieces of information that your 
report will display. To select the columns that will show up in the table, click 
the desired checkboxes in the column panel on the left side of the screen. The 
column panel is divided into 2 parts: Metrics and Attributes. At least one of 
each has to be selected in order to produce a comprehensible report. Metrics and 
attributes are explained in detail in a later section.<span style="COLOR: red"> 
</span>Once you click them, they will be added to the report definition:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image10_6.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The filters allow you to narrow down your results – basically 
deciding which rows should be included in your analysis. The available filters 
are displayed on the right side of the screen in a separate panel. Depending on 
the data type (e.g. a calendar month, text string, etc.), you will see different 
screen controls that are most appropriate for searching through the different 
values. <br /><br /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As an example, let’s say you’re interested in the 
following:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“I want to see our case volume for each product category, for 
just the ones we shipped to public cafeterias.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In this example, you would specify a simple report with two 
columns (Cases (Metric), Category (Attribute)) and one filter (Cafeteria - 
Public). It would look like this after you select the columns and specify the 
filter:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <img src="../ImagesExt/image10_7.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remember that only the columns that you select show up in the 
report results. A filter acts behind the scenes, telling the application which 
rows should be added up when tabulating the results and showing them to you. If 
you want to see the Cafeteria names in the report results, you would simply have 
to select the column for Customers as another column to display. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To remove columns or filters from the report definition, you 
can either un-check the box (in the case of columns), or you can click on the 
‘X’ attached to the column or filter in the Report Definition.</p>
