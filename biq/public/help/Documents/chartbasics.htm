<h3>Chart Basics</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Charts are intended to help you uncover meaningful patterns 
in your analyses through visual display of data. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="../ImagesExt/image10_48.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the screen shot shows, users can control several aspects 
of the chart display. Some of the key points can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">3.  Data 
series are interactive: Hovering over a chart element will reveal its value in a 
tooltip; clicking on a series from the legend hides it from view and re-scales 
the chart if necessary.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">4.  You 
can control how much data to show – The row slider in the top left of the chart 
panel dictates how many of the rows in your result set should be visible in the 
chart. You can drag the slider bars to dictate which rows you want to see, which 
will cause the chart to re-draw automatically.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">5.  What 
is in the grid influences the chart – Because you are determining which rows of 
your result set to show, the sort order in the grid matters. If the table is 
sorted in ascending order for a particular column, the chart will most likely 
look different than if it is sorted in descending order.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">6.  Not 
all charts are always available – BusinessIQ prevents you from selecting charts 
which are not compatible with the number of metrics and/or attributes that you 
have selected.</p>
