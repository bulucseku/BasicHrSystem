<h3><a name="_Conditional_Metrics:_Only" id="_Conditional_Metrics:_Only"></a>Conditional Metrics: Only When <span style="COLOR: red"></span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you apply a filter to a BIQ report definition, that 
filter will be applied to every metric included in the report. Sometimes, 
however, you may want to apply different filters to different metrics or even 
different filters to the same metric. The ability to target your filters to 
individual metrics comes in handy when your data repository has many different 
metrics with their own dimensions (i.e. attributes specific to each of 
them).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For example, say you wanted to view your company’s shipments 
to US Foods Company (a distributor), and also in the same report see any rebate 
claims that your company received for your breads and rolls products. Applying 
normal filters in this case will generate a result that is likely different from 
what you are looking for:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image10_26.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The results may look right, but think carefully. Both filters 
have been applied to both metrics. But what we <b>wanted</b> to see was the 
total shipments to US Foods, not just the shipments of bread and rolls products 
to US Foods. Similarly, we were interested in <b>all</b> rebate claims on bread 
and rolls purchases, not just the ones involving US Foods. Conditional metrics 
are what allow you to do this.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br />Conditional metrics allow you to target applicable 
filters to different metrics, or create multiple filtered versions of the same 
metric. This is especially powerful for doing side-by-side time period 
comparisons (YoY, MoM, etc.), product-to-product comparisons, and similar 
analytical comparisons.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Create a conditional metric as follows:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">3.  Add a 
metric to your report definition and then click on the metric header. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">4.  Click 
on ONLY WHEN (this will only appear for metrics). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 50.4pt"><img src="../ImagesExt/image10_27.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">5.  The 
Condition Metric Editor window appears. Scroll through the filter panel to find 
the exact value(s) that you would like to filter your metric by, and 
single-click on those value(s). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 21.6pt"><img src="../ImagesExt/image10_28.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">6.  The 
conditional metric name will now show the filter value in parentheses alongside 
it. You are able to change the default name by using the text box. To restore 
the default conditional metric name, simply click on the RESTORE DEFAULT NAME 
button. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">7.  To be 
able to frequently re-use a conditional metric, you can save it by checking the 
Re-use box at the bottom of the Conditional Metric Editor window. Your saved 
Conditional Metrics will be visible in the Derived Metrics section that is part 
of the Columns panel. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">8.  Click 
OK to confirm.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt"><b>9.   
Note: </b>Creating a conditional metric will un-check that metric in the column 
panel so that you can add it again. <b></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Using Conditional Metrics, the report proposed at the 
beginning of this explanation should look like this:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image10_29.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You are now able to edit your conditional metric by expanding 
the column header and clicking on Only When: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image10_30.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After you have saved your Conditional Metric, you can still 
edit it or delete it by clicking on the X<span style="FONT-SIZE: 6pt">2</span> 
icon in the Derived Metrics header. Then, click on the pencil icon to edit your 
Conditional Metrics or the ‘X’ icon to delete it:</p>
