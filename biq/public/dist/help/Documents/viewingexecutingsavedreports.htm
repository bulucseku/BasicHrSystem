(Executing) Saved Reports</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you click VIEW for a saved report, the report definition 
associated with the saved report will begin executing. When the saved report 
executes, you are in read-only mode, and you will not be able to modify the 
report definition from this screen. However, the executed reports themselves are 
still interactive. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can still drill into the reports, filter metric ranges, 
filter column rows, sort the columns in the results grid, adjust the number of 
rows shown in the chart, show and hide the grid and/or chart, and export the 
results. However, you cannot modify the visualization displayed when you are 
viewing a saved report – this must be changed from the Builder screen. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Note that while the report definition is not visible in the 
same way as in the Report Builder screen, the filters applied to the selected 
columns are visible to give you full context into the report displayed on the 
screen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is important to keep in mind that any range based filters, 
column based filters, column sorting, and row number selection applied to a 
report or booklet in the Reports and Booklets page <b>do not persist</b>; they 
are simply visual changes that cannot be saved to the report you are viewing and 
are discarded when you perform any other action or navigate away from the page.
