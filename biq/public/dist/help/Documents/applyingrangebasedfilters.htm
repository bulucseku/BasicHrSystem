Range Based Filters</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Range based filters allow you to specify and restrict the 
range of numeric columns or metrics in your report. Applying Range-based Filters 
can only be performed after a report has been defined. Range-based Filters can 
be applied to reports you are currently creating in Builder or reports which you 
have created and saved and that are part of the Reports and Booklets page. To 
apply Range-based Filters in the Reports and Booklets page, select a saved 
report or booklet and click VIEW. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once your report or booklet is executed, there are two ways 
to display data filters:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">1.  Click 
on the ribbon icon in the top-right corner of the report panel and select ‘Data 
Filters’ (left image)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">2.  Click 
on the plus (+) icon that is just below the ribbon icon (right image) </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="../ImagesExt/image10_45.png" alt="" />                     
<img border="0" src="../ImagesExt/image10_46.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You are then able to specify, either by using the value input 
boxes or by dragging the slider pins, the specific range you want to filter the 
numeric columns by. If you want to view a single unique numeric value, all you 
have to do is either input the same numeric value in both value input boxes or 
drag the pins till they overlap. Once you have specified a numeric range and 
click OK, the grid and chart are then updated. Also, “Range Filter:” will show 
you the ranges that you have filtered your report by, even if the actual sliders 
are hidden. Note that the ranges you specify are inclusive; in the following 
example, both $54,101,418 and $57,973,837 are included in the results set: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="../ImagesExt/image10_47.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At any point in the process, you can reset all filtering by 
bringing about the Results Transformation dialog and clicking RESET. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is important to keep in mind that any Range-based Filters 
applied to a single report or a booklet report <b>do not persist</b>; they are 
simply visual changes that are not saved and are discarded when you perform any 
other action or navigate away from the page. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Range-based Filters can also be used in the Builder page. 
Similar to the Reports and Booklets page, click on the ribbon icon to access the 
Data Filters. You are then able to use this feature as described above. </p>
