Saved Reports</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Copying a report is simple in BIQ. When you click on a saved 
report, you will see the available options to see DETAILS, EDIT, COPY, and so 
on. Clicking COPY will prompt you to specify a name for the facsimile of the 
original report that you are creating. Once you click OK, the new report will be 
created and will show up as a new report in your saved reports catalog. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Copying is often useful for when you want to be able to 
modify a report that someone has shared with you. When you create a copy, you 
are simply copying that report definition into a new saved report. There is no 
“link” to the original, so you have full edit rights over a report copy that you 
create.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
