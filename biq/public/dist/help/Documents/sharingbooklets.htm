Booklets</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sharing a booklet works exactly the same as sharing a report. 
Click SHARE when you have the desired booklet selected, and then type in the 
name of the colleague that you wish to share the booklet with. If you want to 
provide them with an email notification, type the email text directly into the 
dialogue box and then click OK. You will not have edit privileges on booklets 
that have been shared with you, and the users with whom you share booklets with 
will not be able to edit them. To “un-share” a booklet, click the SHARE button 
as before and when the Share Menu appears, click on the EXISTING RECIPIENTS tab. 
You will then see a list of users with whom you have shared the booklet. To 
unshare, click the UNSHARE button after placing a check next to the desired 
user(s) (or click OK). If you check the box to “Notify existing recipients via 
email?” the existing recipients will receive an automated email informing them 
that you revoked their access to the booklet.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
