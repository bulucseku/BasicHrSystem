<h3>Setting the Report Order in a Booklet</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once you have added reports to a Booklet, you can modify the 
order in which the reports will appear. Click on a report that has been added to 
the Booklet structure to highlight it, and then use the Up/Down arrow buttons to 
move the report forward or backward in the report sequence. To move a report all 
the way to either the top or the bottom of a booklet, click on the TOP / BOTTOM 
button with the desired report highlighted.</p>
