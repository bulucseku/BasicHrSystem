<h3>Metrics with User Defined Aggregations</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">BusinessIQ gives you the ability to aggregate your metrics by 
more than just Sum. For example, you might want to view the average number of 
shipped cases across all distributors or the maximum number of rebate claims 
across all contract customers. You might even be interested in calculating the 
standard deviation of a certain metric. BIQ gives you the ability to do so using 
the User Defined Aggregations feature. After selecting a metric from the columns 
list, simply click on the column header in the Report Definition to reveal the 
derived metrics and user defined aggregations menu (Derived metrics are 
explained later in this section). Expand the ‘Agg By:’ dropdown list to reveal 
the different aggregations you can use: Average, Sum, Count, Max, Min, and 
Standard Deviation. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><br />BIQ allows you to add different aggregations of the same 
metric to your report. Once you have selected a metric and a specific 
aggregation, you can select that same metric again with a different aggregation. 
This is especially helpful if you are trying to compare, for example, gross cost 
(sum) with its average and standard deviation. </p>
