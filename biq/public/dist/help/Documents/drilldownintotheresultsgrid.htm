into the Results Grid</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">BIQ allows you to drill down into certain reports depending 
on the data in your result set. If one of the attributes that you selected is 
part of a hierarchy that has levels beneath it (sales regions and product 
categories are two common examples), you can drill down into the report results 
grid by point-and-click. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The type of cursor that appears when you hover the mouse over 
the grid indicates whether you can drill down or not. When the cursor shows the 
“click me” hand, you can drill into a report. At all other times, the regular 
cursor arrow icon will display when the mouse is hovering above the grid.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you drill into a report, you are actually drilling into 
a specific row and thus BIQ highlights the row that you have selected. In the 
example shown here, the user is drilling into the row that corresponds to BREADS 
AND ROLLS. If you try to drill into a grid where there are more than one 
drill-friendly attribute, the drill menu will prompt you to choose which 
attribute you want to drill into. You can also drill into several at once by 
checking multiple boxes in the menu:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <img border="0" src="../ImagesExt/image10_43.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you click the ‘Drill Down’ button, BIQ will 
automatically update the report filters based on the row that you selected and 
the attributes you chose to drill down into and then executes the new report. If 
the new report results can also be drilled down into, you can click on a row and 
drill down again using the same process. Once you have drilled down to the 
lowest possible level in all attributes, the Drill Menu will alert you that you 
cannot drill any further into the report. </p>
