from Multiple Attribute Forms</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Certain columns (more specifically, certain 
<i>attributes</i>), can be represented in multiple ways. For instance, a 
customer often has both an ID number as well as a name. The same is generally 
true for products, months, and other elements that can go into the report. When 
you expand an attribute column header, you will also see a select option for 
which form of the attribute you want to display:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In this example, the SUPC field can be represented as either 
a name, ID, or a description of that product. If you would like to see all 
three, you can click on all options. When you do this, the report will bring 
back three columns for the SUPC – one for the name, one for the code, and 
another for the description.</p>
