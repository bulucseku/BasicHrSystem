Columns in the Report Definition</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">As you add columns to the report definition, they will be 
added in the order they are clicked, with metrics pushed to the right and 
attributes clustered on the left (explained in more detail in the metrics and 
attributes sections). This is the order in which columns will appear in the 
report as well. To change the order, you can click on the column header in the 
Report Definition (or the Report Grid) and drag to the desired location. </p>
