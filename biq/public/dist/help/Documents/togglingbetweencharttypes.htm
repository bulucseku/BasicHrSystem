<h3>Toggling between Chart Types </h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">BusinessIQ has a standard set of charts that are compatible 
with different report definitions. The number of attributes and metrics in your 
report definition dictate the allowable charts; for example, BIQ will not let 
you create a scatter plot if you only have one metric in your report; you cannot 
create a histogram, pie chart or bubble chart with two metrics; stacked bar 
charts require at least two attributes, and so on. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Depending on the report definition, BIQ will default to a 
particular view that is compatible with the data when your report executes. 
Afterwards, you can toggle between the available chart types in the chart panel. 
Each time you click on a new chart type, the chart view will generate fresh. 
Depending on how much data you are bringing back, this can feel either 
instantaneous, or take several seconds to refresh.</p>
