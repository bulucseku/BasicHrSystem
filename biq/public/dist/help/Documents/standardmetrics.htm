<h3>Standard Metrics</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Standard metrics are the ones that you see in the Columns 
panel under the metrics section with check boxes next to them, <b>excluding</b> 
those in the Derived Metrics section (which are explained later in this 
section). These metrics are usually the familiar financial performance metrics: 
gross sales, costs, volume, and so on. Much of the time, these are likely to be 
the ones that you will be using to do basic analysis and reporting. By default, 
metrics are aggregated as a Sum. For example, if you select ‘Shipped Cases’ and 
‘Branch’, your result set is going to show the sum of all shipped cases in each 
of the different branches. </p>
