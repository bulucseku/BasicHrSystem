<h3>Metric-Dimension Compatibility</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Typically, MarketMover BIQ combines many different kinds of 
metrics into a single table. When this is the case, it is possible that not all 
of the attributes can be combined with every metric in a sensible way. For 
example, your configuration might have a metric called EMAIL OPEN RATE which is 
a measurement of campaign success. There would be a set of attributes that are 
compatible with this metric, such as MARKETING CAMPAIGN, CUSTOMER, and so on. 
However, trying to create a report that breaks out EMAIL OPEN RATE by product 
may not make sense (i.e. your company may not capture information in that way). 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There should be an accompanying document that explains how 
your data repositories have been configured to explain which metrics and 
attributes are compatible with one another, as well as a data dictionary that 
explains what each column means.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
