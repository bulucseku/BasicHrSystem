are Reports and Booklets?</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Reports are, at their core, a set of instructions that tell 
MarketMover what data to bring back for the user, and how to present that data. 
The user specifies a set of columns they want to see in a result set, any custom 
formulas they define, and restrictions to apply to the results (i.e. filters) to 
“define” a report. When the user clicks “Execute”, BusinessIQ takes that set of 
instructions and translates them into SQL code that the database system 
understands. When that code is executed, it generates results in line with the 
user’s instructions, which are displayed in a table and/or in a chart. The user 
can then search through the results, flip through different visual chart 
displays, or modify the instructions and re-execute the report. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Booklets are collections of individual reports arranged in a 
specified order. Within a booklet, the reports each display as interactive 
“pages” that the user can flip through to create interactive, data-centric 
presentations. Both Reports and Booklets are covered in much more detail in this 
section.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
