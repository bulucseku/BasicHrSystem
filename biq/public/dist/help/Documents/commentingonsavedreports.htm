<h3>Commenting on Saved Reports</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Saved reports contain a comment feature that can be docked or 
un-docked from the screen. This tool lets you annotate reports with your own 
comments and notes of interest, and can also be used as a “wiki” feature for 
shared reports, as in the example shown here:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="../ImagesExt/image10_57.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you click the ADD button, the comment will be added to 
the comment log for the report, viewable to anyone with access to it. As more 
comments are added, they will be added to the stream of comments for the report 
as shown here:</p>
