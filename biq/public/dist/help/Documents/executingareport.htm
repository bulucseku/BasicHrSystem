a Report</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you click the VIEW button, BusinessIQ will begin 
executing the instructions in the report definition. BIQ translates the report 
definition as it is represented on the screen into a specific set of 
instructions for how it should interrogate the database and present the final 
results.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After you click VIEW, you will see an execution status bar 
show up directly beneath the report definition with a running time and a CANCEL 
button. The timer lets you know how long the query (report) has been running, 
and the CANCEL button allows you to kill the process mid-stream. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Many if not most queries will return results in a matter of 
seconds. In general, the larger the result set you want to bring back, the 
longer the query will take to execute on the server and then bring the results 
back over your Internet connection to your computer. Because the results need to 
travel over the Internet, your connection speed will influence how long the 
results take to come back.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When your report has finished executing on the server and the 
results have appeared on the screen, the status bar will update with the 
following:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="../ImagesExt/image10_40.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The total execution time and the total number of rows in the 
results table are displayed at the right. You will also now have the option to 
save your report by clicking on the SAVE button. Saving is discussed in a later 
<a class="topic-link" href="savingareport.htm">section</a><span class="MsoHyperlink">. </span></p>
