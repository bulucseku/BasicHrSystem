<h3>How Filters Are Applied to the Report</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Knowing how to apply filters to get the result you expect is 
a critical aspect of BIQ. Before you read any other section of this manual, make 
sure that you understand these two concepts completely:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">17. Within a 
dimension, filter values that you select will be joined by an OR clause in your 
report definition.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">18. Across 
different dimensions, filter values you select will be joined by an AND 
clause</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An example will help clarify:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image10_38.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The report definition specified here will be read by BIQ as, 
“Find all shipments to either Chicago OR Charlotte where the product type was 
‘Beverages’.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Algebraically, we could represent this as:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt"> (Chicago OR Charlotte) AND 
Beverages. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If we added ‘Breads &amp; Rolls’ as another product filter, 
we would then have:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt">(Chicago OR Charlotte) AND 
(Beverages OR Breads &amp; Rolls)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As you begin working in BIQ more and more, this will become 
second nature. However, it is important to understand this at the outset so that 
you can anticipate how the application will interpret your instructions. </p>
