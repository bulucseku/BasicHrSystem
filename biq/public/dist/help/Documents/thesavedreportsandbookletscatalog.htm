Saved Reports and Booklets Catalog</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Saved Reports and Booklets catalog contains reports and 
booklets that you have created and saved as well as those that have been shared 
with you. Booklets and sharing are covered later in this section. As shown here, 
you can specify how you would like your saved reports to be sorted in the 
display; by modification date, creation date, or alphabetical order. Also, you 
can perform a text search to find specific reports. The text search is applied 
to the report name and the report author’s name. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="../ImagesExt/image10_55.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The blank page icon denotes a report that you have saved, 
while the right (outward) – facing arrow signifies a report that you have saved 
and shared with other users. The left-facing arrow on the page icon denotes 
reports that someone else has shared with you. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To open a report, click anywhere in the report description to 
open up the action menu. Clicking VIEW will open (i.e. execute) the report. The 
EDIT button will bring you back into the Report Builder screen, where you can 
edit that report’s definition. This part is covered later in this section. The 
COPY will create a new duplicate version of that report. The DELETE operation 
will delete the report entirely if you created it, and delete it from your 
catalog if someone else shared it with you. The SHARE feature allows you to push 
the report to another user and is covered later in this section.</p>
